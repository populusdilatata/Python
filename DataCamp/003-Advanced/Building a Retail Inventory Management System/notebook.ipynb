Imagine you are working for an e-commerce company called `ShopSmart`, a rapidly growing online retailer that sells a wide range of products, including electronics, clothing, and home goods. As the company expands, efficiently managing inventory becomes crucial to ensure smooth operations and customer satisfaction.\n\nObject-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data or objects rather than functions and logic. OOP allows for modular, reusable, and maintainable code, which is particularly beneficial for complex systems like inventory management systems.","metadata":{},"id":"57d18345-20b3-4b70-ba97-2128059430de","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"You will define two classes `Product` and `Order`, using the implementation requirements detailed below:\n\n# `Product`\n\n- Constructor parameter(s): `self`, `product_id`, `name`, `category`, `quantity`, `price`, and `supplier`.\n- Class-level variable(s): `inventory`.\n\n## `Product` class method(s)\n\n### `add_product()`\n- Parameter(s): `cls`, `name`, `category`, `quantity`, `price`, and `supplier`.\n- Behavior: \n    - Define the `product_id` assuming it's auto-generated incrementally, without any duplicate `product_id` values.\n    - Define a `new_product` variable that will call the constructor of the Product class.\n    - Return the message `\"Product added successfully\"` to know that the product was added successfully.\n\n### `update_product()`\n- Parameter(s): `cls`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`, and `supplier`.\n    - `quantity`, `price`, and `supplier` should have default values of `None`. \n- Behavior: \n    - Check if the `product_id` already exists in the `inventory`.\n    - If `product_id` exists, check for the given parameters in the method if they have a value and update accordingly the product.\n    - Return either one of these messages: `\"Product information updated successfully\"` or `\"Product not found\"`.\n\n### `delete_product()`\n- Parameter(s): `cls`, `product_id`.\n- Behavior: \n    - Check in the inventory list if the given `product_id` was passed as a parameter.\n    - If `product_id` exists then remove the product from the list.\n    - Return either one of these messages: `\"Product deleted successfully\"` or `\"Product not found\"`.\n\n\n# `Order`\n\n- Constructor parameter(s): `self`, `order_id`, `products`, and `customer_info`.\n    - `customer_info` should have a default value of `None`. \n\n## `Order` method(s)\n\n### `place_order()`\n- Parameter(s): `self`, `product_id`, `quantity`, and `customer_info`.\n    - `customer_info` should have a default value of `None`.\n- Behavior: \n    - Append to the `products` list a tuple containing `product_id` and `quantity`.\n    - Assume that each order can only take **one** product. \n    - Return the message: `\"Order placed successfully.
