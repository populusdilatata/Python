#NumPy is used to work with arrays. The array object in NumPy is called ndarray.
#We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

print(arr)
#type(): This built-in Python function tells us the type of the object
#passed to it. Like in above code it shows that arr is numpy.ndarray type.
print(type(arr))
